# Description 

Thesis on the Django framework for Urbana University using AI technology [IOPaint](https://github.com/Sanster/IOPaint?ysclid=m2iwl121js750648984)

# Quick Start

To install, just enter the following commands into the console
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
or
```
pip install django
pip install iopaint
```
The download will be long, be patient...
Now run the Django wrapper separately in the configuration (help-at the top in Pycharm) using the run with the **runserver** parameter. After that, enter the following command through the console
```
iopaint start --model=lama --device=cpu --port=5000
```
That's enough, now you can click on the link from the terminal with django and try the project in action
